      <h1>About</h1>
      <!-- Intro -->
      <p>Hello everyone! My name is Melinda and I grew up with a thirst for adventure and an appetite for exploration. I guess you could say that I've had a map strapped to my back, a compass in my pocket, and a camera hung around my neck. Traveling to me is getting familiar with the unfamiliar. Instead of just glaring into the camera lens to take a snapshot of a mountain, traveling is walking around inside that picture and gazing directly into the mountains’ eyes.  It’s not just looking out at the ocean and seeing waves lap one after another in front of you, but standing before a mass body of water that makes you feel smaller than a microscopic grain of sand while you hear the pounding waves ripple to the edge of the shore as each wave pulls you in and rocks you fast asleep.  It's using all of my senses to take in my surroundings. It's getting away from the norm and sampling a variety of food, exploring the sights and sounds, and getting immersed in another culture by learning about and understanding them as opposed to simply just passing them by. In doing so, I've been able to meet people from all over the world. In the United States, I've been to 38 of the 50 states, but I've traveled to other parts of world as well. Here are a few of my favorite travel destinations outside of the contiguous U.S.</p>

        <h3>Caribbean/Bahamas</h3>
        <p>When I was in college, my family and I took a cruise on board the S/S Norway through Norwegian Cruise Lines to the eastern Caribbean.  It was my first time being out of the states and it was truly an amazing experience! The cruise stopped at four different ports:  St. Thomas, Philipsburg St. Maarten (St. Martin), St. John's, Antigua, and Norwegian's private island in the Bahamas called “Great Stirrup Cay.”  My favorite port on the cruise due to its remarkable beauty was St. John's, Antigua.</p>

        <h3>Hawaii</h3>
        <p>One year, I spent my birthday with my family going to Hawaii where we visited 3 of the islands:  the Big Island, Oahu, and Maui.  On the Big Island, I swam with the dolphins, visited Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, attended a luau, went on a hiking adventure to see Rainbow Falls and Akaka Falls, and tasted poi (let’s just say that I’m not a fan of the taste). On Oahu, I saw the famous Waikiki Beach in addition to immersing myself in history by standing directly above the wreckage of the ship at the USS Arizona Memorial when visiting the Pearl Harbor Memorial. I then went on to explore the Battleship Missouri, and the Bowfin Submarine.  Lastly, on the island of Maui, we swam in the most unbelievably clear, blue water that I’ve ever seen, and took a day-long tour of the Road to Hana in which I was able to follow the Seven Sacred Pools Trail ('Ohe'o Gulch) to see the incredible The Pools at 'Ohe'o in Haleakala National Park.</p>

        <h3>Europe</h3>
        <p>Probably one of my favorite trips was backpacking in Europe where I visited Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. It was my first time having to get a passport stamped, going through customs, and exchanging my U.S. dollars into Euros(&euro;).  It was another world, another language, and much different food.  Prior to arriving, I purchased a 10 day 3 country Eurail pass.  In Switzerland, I stayed at a B&B in Appenzell in the town square with a restaurant/café located directly below.  In Austria, Schladming made a great base camp for all of the cities that I wished to explore.  I went on "The Sound of Music" tour in Salzburg, glided across a ferry and toured a salt-mine in the fairy-tale town of Hallstatt, tried my first apple strudel, toured the Schönbrunn Palace, and marveled at the amazing architecture of the remarkable St. Stephan’s Cathedral in the city of Vienna.  While in Germany, I was able to catch up with the German exchange student that my family hosted when he came to America.  I also took a train and visited the town of Hohenschwangau where I toured Schloss Hohenschwangau and then toured and gazed in the glory of Castle Neuschwanstein (the castle that I’ve heard that Walt Disney modeled Cinderella’s castle after).  The walled city of Rothenburg ob der Tauber was where I sampled my first schneeballen (a round, ball-like shaped short crust pastry that comes in a variety of flavors) and took in the Night Watchmen’s tour.</p>

        <h3>Mexico</h3>
        <p>In Mexico, I was finally able to put my 5 years of learning Spanish to use (4 years in high school and 1 year in college).  My family and I snorkeled, rode jet skis, and parasailed in Cancun, but we also took in a couple of day trips offered by our resort to Tulum and Chichén Itzá.  On our way to Chichén Itzá, we stopped by a small village in which a mother was making homemade tortillas, cooking them, and then allowing us to sample them while her small children scurried about trying to sell their homemade goods to the tourists that boarded our tour bus.  At the complex of Mayan ruins on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, after viewing several others attempt to climb El Castillo or Temple of Kukulcan, I decided it was my turn.  I climbed and crawled my way up some pretty terrifying steps, but it lead me to some pretty spectacular views of what I saw down below.  After awkwardly scrambling down the steps, we once again boarded the bus back to Cancun, we sampled authentic Mexican dishes while listening to a full mariachi band play and sing while we gorged on chips and salsa and quenched our thirst sipping on Margaritas.  In the city of Tulum, we gazed at the El Castillo (castle), perched on the side of a rocky cliff hanging over a white sandy beach above the turquoise sea.  After returning to Cancun, the adventurous spirit in me was still thirsting for more and wanted to break away from the city and the tourists alike so when someone at the resort informed me that there was an island called “Isla Mujeres” not too far away that was accessible by a short boat ride, I talked my family into going.  Once there, we rented golf carts and drove all over touring the island.  We visited La Tortuga Granja, an endangered sea turtle farm, laid in a hammock basking in the sunshine, and then hopped back on the boat to head back to the city and resort.</p>
